      <h2>About Madeline:</h2>
          <p>After sludging through over a year's worth of college quarters persuing science, physics, and math based degrees and other random classes, Madeline has finally found her home in the VCD program at Eastern Washington University. Even though she's only about half a year in (out of four?!?!), she has finally found something worth persuing - something she can apply her long lost love of creativity and usefulness: Design.</p> </section>
     <section class="grid-6">
      <h2>Aspirations:</h2>
          <p> Honestly, I just got into this degree. I hardly even know what's out there! Currently, I have very little experience in many aspects of design. I do, however, have a pretty good intuition on what looks &ldquo;good&rdquo; in regards to layout and planning. Eventually, I aspire to work with (unspecific) layout designing and Web Design (which I didn't know was a thing until I took Web Design this year). Teach me more!
